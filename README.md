# LifePlus

Habit-tracking App 
We believe that commitment is key to developing good habits and good habits are key to successful goals.
That's why we created LifePlus. 
In every newspaper you will see "Things you should do to become Successful", "Tips for success".
By reading these, you gain knowledge but as Napoleon Hill said "Knowledge is only potential power. It becomes power only when, and if, it is organized into definite plans of action, and directed to a definite end."

Those definite plans of action are habits. Willpower is for short term and habits are what keep you going in the long term.
